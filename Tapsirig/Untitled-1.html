        <H1>Responsive Layouts Without Bootstrap</H1>     
        
        <p class="p1">This is simple demonstration of organizing different elements without bootstrap so that when a browser is resized the elements<br> adjust accordingly. The goal is obviously to be completely functional with as simple coding as possible. This means avoiding<br> media queries when possible etc. Maybe this is common knowledge for most but as I am growing and learing, I have not found a<br> comprehensive tutorial on the web with this stuff. SO..here is my two cents.</p1>
        <br>
        <H2>Working with Inline Block</H2>
        <p class="p2">Let is say you have a group of objects that are similar in size and shape. A common scenario would be if you had multiple images or icons that<br>you are setting side by side in a row. In our case, we'll use boxes. The easiest set-up is to set them in a parent cpntainer with text-align: center; to<br>center them and then give each element a display:inline or inline-block. FYI, you do have to declare a width in order for this to work. Just keeping<br>it real.</p>
